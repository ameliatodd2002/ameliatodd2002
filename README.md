# Hi, I'm Amelia!

I'm a data science student with a background in psychology. Iâ€™m passionate about transforming large datasets into stories that help businesses and organizations make data-driven decisions. Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my expertise in machine learning and learning SQL.

I have experience working with datasets in Excel (VLOOKUP, COUNTIFS) and Python, where I integrate and manipulate data from various sources. I'm always looking to learn more and challenge myself with new projects.

If you have any suggestions or opportunities, feel free to reach out (email: ameliatodd2002@gmail.com) as Iâ€™m actively seeking internship and job opportunities.

## More about me:

I have hands-on experience in data analysis, using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for processing and analyzing large datasets. My work includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), building statistical models, and creating visualizations to communicate insights.

I hold a B.S. in Psychology from Louisiana State University, where I worked as a Data Integration Specialist for the Suicide Prevention Research Team. I organized and analyzed large datasets using Excel and SPSS and developed a Python script to automate data organization via API.

At the University of Texas, I expanded my statistical modeling skills, focusing on random forest models and other machine learning techniques, which you can view in my GitHub repositories.
